## Smart Outreach Assistant
An intelligent AI-powered assistant created for service-based companies to streamline cold outreach. Built with Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit, this tool allows users to enter the URL of a companyâ€™s careers page, automatically extract job postings, and generate customized cold emails. These emails include curated portfolio links, matched intelligently from a vector database based on the job descriptions.

## Use Case: Real-World Scenario
Imagine Nike is looking to hire a Principal Software Engineer. Instead of going through the lengthy recruitment pipeline, AI_in_Need, a software service provider, wants to offer one of their expert engineers as an outsourced solution.

Farah, the business development executive at AI_in_Need, uses this app to automatically craft a tailored cold email for Nikeâ€”highlighting relevant projects and skills that align with the job posting. This not only saves Nike time and resources, but also creates a business opportunity for AI_in_Need.
